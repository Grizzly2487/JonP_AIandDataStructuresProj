First 48 text game.

your a detective trying to solve the case within the first 48 hours (48 turns equivelant)
3 case scenarios with 3 outcomes, each having a predetermined killer that is 1 of the 6 suspects.

Switch Case for player choices (question suspect 1/2/3/4/5/6,accuse of being liar * 6
			       (costs 8 turns if wrong ontop of 1 turn already taken),change suspect * 6, and solve case)

Suspects with dialogue and clues (boolean to say if they are a liar or not. If player guesses they are, 
				change the dialogue/get clue.If they are not and player said they were, 
				loose 8 turns. Also have the killer boolean randomized 
				between 3 predetermined killers for each of the 3 cases possible.)

**Case Class and Case Manager needed(Linked List in Case Manager)**

Suspects will be put into lists for each case.Case will be randomly chosen and 3 suspects will be randomly chosen.

Suspects will have a FSM for their emotions and will make the Suspects AI choose different dialogue accordingly. Have a weight system for decisions of AI.

Killer is chosen by - randomizeKiller(){ //randomnly pick one of the three liars chosen as the killer using random range}

Each liar has a clue with them to solve the case. And a chance to be the killer themselves.
If the liar is a killer and player accused correctly, solve the case. If the liar is not the killer and player accused,
change dialoge and give the clue.

Player solves the case by choosing one of the suspects as the killer if they have not already accused one of them of lieing 
and was the killer.If all 3 clues are gathered the killer will be cought automaticly and solve the case.
